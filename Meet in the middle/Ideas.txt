//// it is like making something as pivot

// Four sum problem is perfect for getting a feel of this:)

-> count no. of triplets ai<aj<ak
Soln:
N^3 -> simple brute
N^2 -> meet in the middle,  for each j, smaller on left*larger on right
NlogN is also possible:)


-> similarly for 5lets,
i,j,k,l,m
N^5 can be converted into n^3(n^2 on both side of j)

-> similar approach problem
: count no. of paths with 5 nodes.
