// Print -1 for no solution?
-> check minimum and maximum value possible
-> Maybe there is only 1 case possible
-> find all 'yes' and remaining will be '-1'
-> stress testing code check:)


// Change question -> now search for solution of new problem -> binary search



// maximum subarray length?
-> code for each subarray length
-> binary search on subarray length:)
-> use segment tree


// Change idea, not implementation
// Change implementation if -> unecessary if/else
